# Project: Inverted Pendulum on a Moving Cart - 3D Model and Control
# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to model, simulate, and control an inverted pendulum mounted on a moving cart. The system is inherently unstable, making it a classic problem in the field of control systems. By employing advanced control strategies, we aim to stabilize the pendulum in an upright position while controlling the motion of the cart.
# System Description
The system consists of:

- A moving cart that can travel along a linear track.
- An inverted pendulum that is attached to the cart's top. The pendulum is free to rotate around its pivot point.
- The challenge is to balance the pendulum in an upright position by controlling the motion of the cart. The goal is to achieve this balance while also controlling the cart's movement.
